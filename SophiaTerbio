I want to explore new places. I want to be Independent. Hey, the name's Sophia Louisse Terbio and I love daydreaming. 
Born on the 20th of August in 1999 at the province of Palawan. I am very socially awkward so please bear with me. 
I don't even know what to write right now so I'll just type something whatever comes to mind. Frustrated guitarist since '11. 
An aspiring Aeronautical Engineer. Potato chips over pizza, popcorn over chocolate, and my mom and sister over everything else. 
Films, roller coaster rides, and hikings make my life less boring. I love it when the sun gets covered up by big, fluffy, beautiful 
clouds and fresh air carressing my skin. I love the sound of heavy rain falling but I hate the smell of wet soil.

What you've read from above was what I wrote in my Tumblr "About Me" section when I was in 8th grade. It's amazing how sure I am about my
life back then, of what I wanted to be, of what I liked and disliked. Oh how I wish my 14 year old self could talk some sense in to me now.
I am taking up my 2nd year in engineering at one of the best schools here in the country and yet, here I am, thinking about shifting courses.
I have always been fascinated and interested in engineering but merely because both of my parents are CEs. However, I have always been
much more interactive when watching, playing, or talking about crimes, investigations, and conspiracy theories than participating in
tech talks and projects. This thursday, I finally was able to watch The Silence of the Lambs--I've always loved horror and thrillers and this movie has
been on my watch list for years now--and I only have one take away from the movie;

I am Sophia Louisse Lague Terbio, 20 years old, standing 5'4" tall, weighing 50 kgs, with a normal BMI, and I want to be a criminal investigator.



...I'd still finish engineering though. Mahal ang tuition, sayang nagastos.
